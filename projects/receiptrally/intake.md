# Market Research Intake: ReceiptRally

## Basic Info
**App Name**: ReceiptRally
**One-Line Description**: Auto-capture and categorize business receipts so freelancers can export expenses in minutes
**Your Role**: Founder & Developer
**Date**: 2026-01-14

## The Problem (in your words)
I lose time and money every month chasing receipts. They land in email, screenshots, PDF downloads, and random folders. When it is time to reconcile expenses, I:

1. Search Gmail for "receipt" and "invoice"
2. Dig through Downloads and Desktop folders
3. Rename files manually
4. Enter totals into a spreadsheet
5. Guess categories later
6. Realize some receipts are missing
7. Repeat the process again at tax time

This takes 2-4 hours per month and I still miss deductions. The exact phrase I say to myself: "Where did that receipt go?"

## Target Avatar (your hypothesis)
**Who**: Freelancers, consultants, and small agencies on Mac who manage their own bookkeeping

**Where they are**:
- r/freelance
- r/smallbusiness
- r/accounting
- r/Entrepreneur
- Indie Hackers
- QuickBooks community forums
- Twitter/X #freelance

**What they currently use**:
- Expensify or Dext (subscription fatigue)
- QuickBooks or FreshBooks (overkill)
- Spreadsheets + Google Drive
- Apple Notes or Photos for receipts
- Shoeboxed (mail-in scanning)

**Why they'd care**:
- Saves 2-4 hours every month
- Reduces missed deductions and audit stress
- Keeps data private (local-first)
- Feels lightweight compared to full accounting suites

## Your Unique Approach
**What makes you different**: A lightweight macOS menu bar app that automatically finds receipts in email and Downloads, runs OCR locally, and exports a clean CSV or QuickBooks file in one click.

**Why this matters**:
1. Speed: 10 minutes to reconcile vs. 2-4 hours manual
2. Privacy: local-first, no cloud uploads required
3. Simplicity: no accounting setup, just receipts
4. Coverage: captures receipts people forget (email, PDFs, screenshots)

Current solutions are either:
- Full accounting suites (too heavy)
- Subscription receipt scanners (too expensive)
- Manual spreadsheet workflows (too slow)

We're the ONLY option that is local-first, lightweight, and built for freelancers who want receipts handled fast.

## Initial Assumptions (we'll validate these)
- **Market size**: $100-200M TAM (freelancers + small agencies doing their own bookkeeping)
- **Willingness to pay**: $39-$69 one-time purchase (utility app pricing)
- **Competitive advantage**: local-first + auto-capture from email/Downloads
- **Time to build MVP**: 3-4 weeks (macOS app with OCR + export)
- **Path to first 100 customers**: Indie Hackers, r/freelance posts, tax-season content

## Research Priorities (what you most want to know)
1. **Is the receipt chaos pain real for freelancers?** Or do most people just tolerate it?
2. **Will they pay for a lightweight tool vs. a full accounting suite?**
3. **Do they care about local-first privacy?** Or is cloud acceptable?
4. **Which integrations matter most?** (CSV, QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Wave)

## Constraints
**Time budget**: 15 hours max for research
**Money budget**: $50 max (API/scraping tools)
**Launch timeline**: Want to decide GO/NO-GO within 1 week (by Jan 21, 2026)
**Risk tolerance**: Medium - willing to build a 3-4 week MVP if research is positive

## What success looks like
After research, I want to know:
- [ ] Clear answer: should I build this? (GO/NO-GO with confidence score)
- [ ] If GO: what is the exact positioning, pricing ($39 vs $69?), and launch strategy?
- [ ] If NO-GO: why not and what should I pivot to? (Maybe different avatar or integration?)

## Notes for Research System
- Focus on freelancers and small agencies first
- Keep scope to macOS, not enterprise
- Pay attention to tax season timing and launch windows
- I am the avatar, but need external validation from 5-10 others
