# Market Research Intake: QuickRephrase

## Basic Info
**App Name**: QuickRephrase
**One-Line Description**: Instant AI text transformation without leaving your current app
**Your Role**: Founder & Developer
**Date**: 2026-01-14

## The Problem (in your words)
I constantly need to rephrase text when writing emails, Slack messages, tweets, and content. The current workflow is terrible:

1. Write something that sounds wrong (too formal, too casual, too long)
2. Realize I need to fix it
3. Open a new tab
4. Go to ChatGPT
5. Copy the text
6. Paste into ChatGPT
7. Wait for response
8. Copy the result
9. Go back to original tab
10. Paste the rewritten text
11. Format it to match
12. Continue writing

This takes 2-3 minutes EVERY time and breaks my flow completely. I do this 5-10 times per day, which means I waste 10-30 minutes daily just switching between apps.

The exact phrase I say to myself: "Ugh, this sounds like a robot wrote it" or "I need to make this more casual" or "This is way too long."

## Target Avatar (your hypothesis)
**Who**: Mac users who write content daily - specifically developers, founders, content creators, and marketers who care about how their writing sounds

**Where they are**:
- r/productivity (3M members)
- r/MacApps (185K members)
- r/SideProject (220K members)
- Twitter #MacProductivity
- Indie Hackers
- Product Hunt

**What they currently use**:
- ChatGPT (manual tab switching)
- TextExpander (but no AI - just static snippets)
- Grammarly (grammar only, not rephrasing)
- Alfred workflows (clunky, not AI-powered)

**Why they'd care**:
- Saves 10-30 min/day (worth $25-75/day at $150/hr rate)
- Keeps them in flow (no tab switching)
- Makes writing feel effortless
- Looks professional without effort

## Your Unique Approach
**What makes you different**: AI-powered text transformation at the exact point of writing. Select text -> right-click (or keyboard shortcut) -> instant transformation. No app switching, no copy-paste, no waiting.

**Why this matters**:
1. Speed: 5 seconds vs. 2 minutes (24x faster)
2. Flow: Stay in current app vs. context switching
3. Simplicity: One action vs. 11-step workflow
4. Integration: Works everywhere (Gmail, Slack, Notion, any text field)

Current solutions are either:
- AI-powered but require app switching (ChatGPT)
- Integrated but not AI (TextExpander, Alfred)
- Grammar-focused not rewriting (Grammarly)

We're the ONLY solution that's both AI-powered AND integrated at point of writing.

## Initial Assumptions (we'll validate these)
- **Market size**: $50-100M TAM (Mac productivity tools market)
- **Willingness to pay**: $29-$47 one-time purchase (comparable to PopClip $15, Alfred Powerpack $34)
- **Competitive advantage**: 10x faster workflow, first-mover in "AI at point of writing"
- **Time to build MVP**: 2 weeks (macOS app with context menu + keyboard shortcut + 5 transform types)
- **Path to first 100 customers**: Reddit posts (r/MacApps, r/productivity), Product Hunt launch, Twitter demo threads

## Research Priorities (what you most want to know)
1. **Is the "flow breaking" pain real for others or just me?** Do other people hate the ChatGPT tab-switching workflow?
2. **How much would they actually pay?** Is $47 too high? Would they prefer $19? Subscription vs. one-time?
3. **Will TextExpander/Alfred/competitors add AI soon?** Are we in a race? Do we have 6 months or 6 weeks before they catch up?
4. **Can I reach enough people organically?** Or will I need paid ads (which would kill economics)?

## Constraints
**Time budget**: 15 hours max for research
**Money budget**: $50 max (API/scraping tools)
**Launch timeline**: Want to decide GO/NO-GO within 1 week (by Jan 21, 2026)
**Risk tolerance**: Medium - willing to spend 2 weeks building if research is positive, but not 2 months if it's unclear

## What success looks like
After research, I want to know:
- [ ] Clear answer: should I build this? (GO/NO-GO with confidence score)
- [ ] If GO: what's the exact positioning, pricing ($29 vs $47?), and launch strategy?
- [ ] If NO-GO: why not and what should I pivot to? (Maybe different avatar? Different problem?)

## Notes for Research System
- Focus on Mac users initially (Windows version can be Phase 2)
- Don't research mobile (not relevant for this workflow)
- Pay special attention to competitor timing (threat of incumbents adding AI)
- I'm the avatar myself (can self-interview), but need external validation from 5-10 others
