# Market Research Intake: {{APP_NAME}}

## Basic Info
**App Name**: [Your app name]
**One-Line Description**: [What it does in one sentence]
**Your Role**: [Founder/Developer/etc]
**Date**: {{TODAY}}

## The Problem (in your words)
[Describe the problem you're solving. Be specific about frustrations.]

Example: "I spend 2-4 hours every month hunting down receipts across email and Downloads, renaming files, and entering totals for taxes. I still miss deductions."

## Target Avatar (your hypothesis)
**Who**: [Specific type of person - be narrow, not "everyone"]
**Where they are**: [Specific communities - r/freelance, r/smallbusiness, Indie Hackers]
**What they currently use**: [Current solutions - Expensify, QuickBooks, spreadsheets]
**Why they'd care**: [Why your solution matters - saves time, reduces missed deductions]

## Your Unique Approach
**What makes you different**: [Your unique mechanism]
**Why this matters**: [Why the difference is valuable, not just a feature]

Example: "Local-first receipt capture that automatically finds receipts in email/Downloads, runs OCR on-device, and exports a clean CSV in one click. This matters because existing tools are either heavy accounting suites or subscription scanners."

## Initial Assumptions (we'll validate these)
- **Market size**: [Your TAM estimate - e.g., $100-200M for freelancer bookkeeping tools]
- **Willingness to pay**: [Your pricing hypothesis - e.g., $39-$69 one-time purchase]
- **Competitive advantage**: [What makes you 10x better - e.g., 10x faster month-end cleanup]
- **Time to build MVP**: [Your timeline estimate - e.g., 3-4 weeks]
- **Path to first 100 customers**: [Your GTM hypothesis - e.g., Reddit, Indie Hackers, tax season content]

## Research Priorities (what you most want to know)
1. [Question 1 - e.g., Is receipt chaos a real pain for others or just me?]
2. [Question 2 - e.g., How much would they actually pay for this?]
3. [Question 3 - e.g., Do they prefer local-first or cloud tools?]
4. [Question 4 - e.g., Can I reach enough people organically?]

## Constraints
**Time budget**: [X hours max for research - e.g., 15 hours]
**Money budget**: [$X max for tools/APIs - e.g., $50]
**Launch timeline**: [When you want to decide GO/NO-GO - e.g., within 1 week]
**Risk tolerance**: [Low/Medium/High - e.g., Medium - willing to spend 3-4 weeks building if research is positive]

## What success looks like
After research, I want to know:
- [ ] Clear answer: should I build this? (GO/NO-GO)
- [ ] If GO: what's the positioning, pricing, and launch strategy?
- [ ] If NO-GO: why not and what should I do instead?
