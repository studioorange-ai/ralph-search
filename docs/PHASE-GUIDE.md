# Phase-by-Phase Methodology Guide

This guide explains the methodology behind each research phase, what we're looking for, and how to interpret results.

---

## Phase 1: Market Landscape Scan

### Purpose
Validate that a real market exists before investing time in deeper research. This is the "is there even a there there?" check.

### What We're Looking For
1. **Competitors exist**: If no one is selling solutions, there's no proven willingness to pay
2. **Market is big enough**: TAM > $10M means you can build a sustainable business
3. **Market is growing/stable**: Declining markets are death traps
4. **Avatar is reachable**: You need to know WHERE to find customers

### Success Criteria
| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Competitors | 5+ with pricing | <5 or no pricing |
| TAM | >$10M/year | <$10M/year |
| Growth | Stable or up | Declining >10%/year |
| Communities | 3+ active | Can't find any |

### Common Outcomes

**PASS Example:**
> Found 12 competitors in AI writing space. TAM calculated at $45M using bottoms-up (150K target users x $300/year). Google Trends shows 40% growth. Avatar active in r/productivity, r/MacApps, Indie Hackers.

**FAIL Example:**
> Only found 2 competitors, both abandoned. TAM estimate is $3M even with generous assumptions. Market showing decline as ChatGPT absorbs use cases.

### Red Flags
- All competitors are VC-funded giants (hard to compete)
- Pricing is all over the place (market not established)
- Recent shutdowns/pivots in the space
- Category being disrupted by free alternatives

## Phase 2: Avatar Pain Mining

### Purpose
Find verbatim evidence that real people actually experience this problem and care enough to solve it. This validates that the problem isn't just in the founder's imagination.

### What We're Looking For
1. **Verbatim quotes**: Actual words from real users expressing pain
2. **Multiple pain themes**: Multi-dimensional pain = bigger opportunity
3. **Active workarounds**: Proves willingness to act (not just complain)
4. **High frequency**: Weekly+ problems justify tool purchases
5. **Economic cost**: Problem must be expensive enough to pay for solution

### Success Criteria
| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| Quotes | 50+ verbatim | <50 quotes |
| Themes | 3+ distinct | 1-2 themes |
| Workarounds | Documented | None found |
| Frequency | Weekly+ | Monthly or less |
| Cost | >$100/year | <$100/year |

### Pain Intensity Scale

**Level 5 - Desperate** (Best):
- "I would pay anything for..."
- "This is killing my productivity"

**Level 4 - Frustrated**:
- "I hate having to..."
- "So annoying when..."

**Level 3 - Inconvenienced**:
- "It takes too long to..."
- "Wish there was a better way"

**Level 2 - Aware**:
- "Sometimes I notice..."
- "It's a bit of a hassle"

**Level 1 - Indifferent** (Worst):
- "Not a big deal but..."
- "I guess I could use..."

Target: Majority of quotes should be Level 4-5.

### Red Flags
- All quotes from founder's network (bias)
- Quotes express desire but not pain
- No workarounds (people don't care enough)
- Pain is infrequent or situational

---

## Phase 3: Competitive Differentiation

### Purpose
Find the unique angle that makes your product the obvious choice for the avatar. "Why you?" is the key question.

### What We're Looking For
1. **10x dimension**: One area where you're dramatically better
2. **Gap-pain alignment**: Your advantage addresses a real pain point
3. **Review validation**: Customers complaining about gaps you solve
4. **Defensibility**: Can incumbents copy you quickly?

### Success Criteria
| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| 10x better | Yes, in one dimension | Just incrementally better |
| Gap maps to pain | High-intensity pain | Low-priority issue |
| Review evidence | 20+ complaints | Few complaints |
| Defensible | 12+ months | <6 months |

### The 10x Question
You need to be 10x better in ONE dimension, not 10% better in many:
- **Speed**: 24x faster (5 sec vs 2 min)
- **Simplicity**: 1 step vs 11 steps
- **Integration**: Works everywhere vs. requires app switch
- **Price**: 10x cheaper
- **Quality**: Dramatically better output

### Red Flags
- Can't identify a 10x dimension
- Advantage is in something avatar doesn't care about
- Competitors already shipping similar features
- Easy for incumbents to copy (no moat)

## Phase 4: Pricing & Economics

### Purpose
Validate that the business can actually make money. Great product + bad economics = failed business.

### What We're Looking For
1. **Clear ROI**: Price is small fraction of problem cost
2. **Healthy LTV:CAC**: Ratio > 3:1 for sustainability
3. **Model match**: Business model fits how avatar buys
4. **High margin**: Software should have 70%+ gross margin

### Success Criteria
| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| ROI | <30% of problem cost | >30% of problem cost |
| LTV:CAC | >3:1 | <3:1 |
| Model match | Fits avatar psychology | Friction/mismatch |
| Gross margin | >70% | <70% |

### Business Model Options

**One-Time Purchase**
- Best for: Utilities, tools with long-term value
- Mac users prefer this for productivity tools
- LTV = price (no churn, no expansion)

**Subscription**
- Best for: Ongoing value, regular updates
- Monthly billing preferred by some segments
- LTV = (price x retention months)

**Usage-Based**
- Best for: Variable consumption
- Works for API-heavy products
- LTV = (avg usage x price x retention)

### Red Flags
- LTV:CAC < 2:1 even optimistically
- Margin eaten by API costs
- Model contradicts how avatar buys
- No clear ROI story

## Phase 5: Go-To-Market Strategy

### Purpose
Validate that you can actually reach the avatar cost-effectively. The best product fails if no one sees it.

### What We're Looking For
1. **Affordable channels**: CAC < $50 in multiple channels
2. **Sufficient reach**: Can reach 1,000+ avatars in 30 days
3. **Proven playbooks**: Recent successful launches to learn from
4. **Clear path to 100**: Specific plan to get first customers

### Success Criteria
| Criterion | Pass | Fail |
|-----------|------|------|
| CAC channels | 2+ under $50 | 0-1 under $50 |
| 30-day reach | 1,000+ avatars | <1,000 avatars |
| Launch examples | 3+ recent | 0-2 recent |
| Path to 100 | Clear plan | Vague hope |

### Channel Reality Check

| Channel | Typical CAC | Reach | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Reddit | $0-10 | High | Niche products |
| Product Hunt | $5-20 | Medium-high | Dev/tech tools |
| Twitter | $10-50 | Variable | Personal brands |
| Content/SEO | $20-50 | Slow build | Long-term |
| Paid Ads | $50-200 | Fast | Validated products |

### Conversion Funnel Math
- Reach: 1,000 see your post
- Click: 5-10% (50-100 visits)
- Try: 10-20% (5-20 signups)
- Buy: 5-20% (1-4 customers)
- **Net: 0.1-0.4% of reach becomes customers**

For 100 customers, you typically need 25,000-100,000 reach.

### Red Flags
- Only paid channels work (expensive)
- Avatar not in identifiable communities
- Recent launches in space all failed
- Path to 100 requires unrealistic conversion

## Phase 6: Final Synthesis

### Purpose
Combine all findings into an actionable GO/NO-GO decision with clear reasoning.

### Weighted Scoring
| Phase | Weight | Reasoning |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Market Size | 15% | Foundation, but small markets can work |
| Avatar Pain | 30% | Most important - no pain = no customers |
| Differentiation | 25% | Must have reason to exist |
| Economics | 20% | Must be sustainable |
| GTM | 10% | Can adapt, but must be possible |

### Decision Rubric

**STRONG GO (8.0+)**
- All must-haves pass
- High confidence across phases
- Risks are known and manageable
- Clear path to success

**CONDITIONAL GO (6.5-7.9)**
- Must-haves pass but with caveats
- Some phases borderline
- Specific weaknesses to address
- Proceed with caution

**WEAK GO (5.0-6.4)**
- Borderline must-haves
- Multiple concerning flags
- High risk of failure
- Consider alternatives

**NO-GO (<5.0)**
- One or more must-haves fail
- Fundamental problems
- Pivot or abandon
- Research other ideas

### Interpreting Results

**The goal isn't a perfect score.** Even a 7.0 with known risks can be a great opportunity if:
- You understand the risks
- You have mitigation strategies
- The upside justifies the risk
- You can iterate quickly

**NO-GO isn't failure.** It's success - you avoided wasting months building something that wouldn't work. Research other ideas!

## Summary Table

| Phase | Key Question | Pass Signal | Fail Signal |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Is there a market? | 5+ competitors, $10M+ TAM | No competitors, tiny TAM |
| 2 | Is the pain real? | 50+ quotes, workarounds exist | Few quotes, no action |
| 3 | Are you differentiated? | 10x in one dimension | Incrementally better |
| 4 | Do economics work? | LTV:CAC > 3:1, 70%+ margin | Bad ratios, low margin |
| 5 | Can you reach them? | Multiple channels, clear plan | No affordable channels |
| 6 | GO or NO-GO? | Score 6.5+ | Score <5.0 |

*Remember: The purpose of research is to make better decisions faster. A quick "no" is better than a slow "yes" to the wrong idea.*
